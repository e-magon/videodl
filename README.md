# VideoDL
Minimal node.js application & website to download video and audio files from an internet URL.

The server requires `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg` to be installed and the webpage has to be served over HTTPS.

You also need to create a file named `hashedpassword.txt` near `server.js` containing the SHA256 of a password you want to use to access the website.

After you enter the password, it will be stored in a cookie so it won't ask you again for it.

### TODO:
- Make so that the client doesn't save the hashed password in the cookie but it saves a unique ID generated by the server, who keeps track of which IDs it generated and are still valid.
